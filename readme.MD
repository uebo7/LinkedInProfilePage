# LinkedIn Profile
### The linkedIn Profile allows a user accessing the website, which uses full CRUD, to create a profile about themselves. This includes accomplishments they have completed, personal things about themselves, education, and experience they have. Each user can create one profile per account, but will have the option to update or delete information within it at any time. The entire profile can also be deleted if the user wishes to start from scratch.
